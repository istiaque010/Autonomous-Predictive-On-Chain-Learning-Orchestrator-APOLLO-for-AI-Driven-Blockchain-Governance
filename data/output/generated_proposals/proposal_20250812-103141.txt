Title: Immediate Treasury Review & DeFi Incentive Shift

Rationale: Recent community sentiment overwhelmingly expresses frustration with Polkadot’s governance, particularly concerning high inflation, excessive staking rewards, and perceived waste. On-chain activity reveals declining engagement with governance and a strong desire for a more focused approach. The extremely low turnout (averaging 2.16% and a median of 2.16%) on existing proposals underscores a critical disconnect. Market volatility, driven by inflation data, further emphasizes the need for decisive action to stabilize the ecosystem and address immediate concerns. This proposal directly responds to these concerns by initiating a rapid review of the treasury and prioritizing DeFi incentive programs.

Action:
1.  **Immediate Treasury Review (7-day duration):** The Foundation will conduct a comprehensive review of the treasury’s allocation, focusing on reducing inflationary pressures and identifying opportunities for strategic investment. This review will include a detailed analysis of staking rewards and potential mechanisms for reducing their impact.
2.  **DeFi Incentive Program Launch (Concurrent with Review):** Initiate a pilot program offering grants and bounties specifically targeting DeFi projects building on Polkadot. The initial focus will be on projects developing innovative cross-chain solutions and utilizing the DOT token. A tiered bounty system will reward active participation and successful outcomes.
3.  **Governance Communication Blitz:** Launch a proactive communication campaign to explain the rationale behind these actions and solicit feedback from the community.

Expected Impact:
*   **Reduced Inflationary Pressure:** By adjusting staking rewards, we can mitigate the ongoing inflationary effects on DOT.
*   **Increased DeFi Activity:** Targeted DeFi incentives will stimulate innovation and growth within the Polkadot ecosystem.
*   **Improved Community Engagement:** Demonstrating responsiveness to community concerns will foster greater trust and participation in future governance decisions.
*   **Stabilized Ecosystem:** Addressing immediate inflationary pressures will contribute to a more stable and attractive environment for DOT holders and developers.
