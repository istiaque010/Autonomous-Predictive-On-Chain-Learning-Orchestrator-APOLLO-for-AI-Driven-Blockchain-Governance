Only 2.48% of the total electorate participates in each referendum, with a median turnout of just 2.15%.  The number of proposals submitted is increasing (55 in February 2025), but monthly participation remains relatively low and volatile (ranging from 34 to 43).  Average proposal duration is 19.52 days.  Top keywords highlight ongoing discussions around funding, ecosystem development, and proposal voting.  The low turnout suggests a need to improve accessibility and awareness within the Polkadot community"
