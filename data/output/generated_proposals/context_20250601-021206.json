Average turnout is extremely low at just 2.48%, and the median is even lower at 2.15%, indicating a substantial portion of the network isn\u2019t participating.  While monthly counts are trending upwards (36-55), the overall volume remains low.  Referenda take an average of 19.52 days to execute.  The top keywords highlight a focus on funding, proposals, and ecosystem development.  Further investigation is needed to understand why participation remains so limited."
