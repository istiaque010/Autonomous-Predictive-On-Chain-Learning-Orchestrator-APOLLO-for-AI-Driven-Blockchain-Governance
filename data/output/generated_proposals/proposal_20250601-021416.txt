**Title:** Boost Voter Engagement Through Small, Frequent Governance Proposals

**Rationale:** Recent governance KPIs highlight critically low voter turnout (2.48% average), indicating a significant disconnect between the network and its decision-making processes. This proposal aims to address this by introducing a mechanism for submitting and voting on smaller, more digestible governance proposals, fostering greater participation and improving overall network responsiveness. The recent community sentiment, particularly regarding the AssetHub migration and tBTC adoption, underscores the importance of proactive governance. Furthermore, the observed uptick in monthly referenda counts (36-55) suggests a latent interest within the ecosystem.

**Action:**
1.  **Introduce “Micro-Proposals”:** Establish a framework for submitting proposals with a minimum voting threshold of 1% of DOT holders. These proposals would focus on relatively minor adjustments, updates, or clarifications within the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g., minor protocol parameter adjustments, clarifications regarding AssetPortal functionality, or updates to staking rewards).
2.  **Streamlined Voting Process:** Simplify the voting process for Micro-Proposals, reducing the time and effort required for participation.
3.  **Community Education Campaign:** Launch a targeted campaign to educate DOT holders about the benefits of participating in governance, emphasizing the importance of their voice.

**Expected Impact:**
*   **Increased Voter Turnout:** By lowering the barrier to entry, we anticipate a measurable increase in voter turnout, moving towards a more representative governance model.
*   **Improved Network Responsiveness:** More frequent, smaller-scale governance decisions will allow the Polkadot ecosystem to adapt more quickly to emerging needs and opportunities.
*   **Enhanced Community Engagement:** Increased participation will foster a stronger sense of ownership and collaboration within the Polkadot community.
