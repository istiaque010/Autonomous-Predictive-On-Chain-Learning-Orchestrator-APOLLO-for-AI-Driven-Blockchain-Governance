    "summary": "The messages reveal significant community skepticism and frustration regarding Polkadot's governance, particularly concerning high inflation, excessive staking rewards, and the perceived inefficiency of the open-governance system. There's a strong desire to reduce inflation, shift capital into DeFi, and eliminate what's seen as wasteful spending by the foundation and related entities. Many users express concern about the lack of real-world value on-ramps and the overall stagnation of the ecosystem. Calls for burning the treasury and a more focused approach to DeFi incentives are prevalent.",
