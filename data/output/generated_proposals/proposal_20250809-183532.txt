Title: Enhance Community Support & Awareness Initiatives

Rationale: Recent governance KPIs highlight a critical issue: consistently low voter turnout (averaging 2.15%) and a fragmented community. This proposal addresses this by initiating targeted support programs and bolstering community safety measures, directly responding to concerns regarding scam awareness and technical problem resolution. The current sentiment emphasizes the need for increased accessibility and proactive support within the Polkadot ecosystem. Recent news regarding commodity crypto and the rise of Sui expansion demonstrate broader market interest, suggesting a need for Polkadot to remain competitive and visible.

Action:
1.  **Launch “Polkadot Pathfinder” Program:** Establish a tiered support system offering mentorship, technical assistance, and educational resources for new and existing Polkadot users. This will be funded through a small, dedicated grant (max 100 DOT).
2.  **Community Scam Awareness Campaign:** Initiate a coordinated campaign, leveraging existing community channels, to educate users about prevalent scams and best practices for security. Partner with reputable Polkadot security experts to develop educational materials.
3.  **Dedicated Support Channel:** Create a clearly designated channel (e.g., a dedicated Discord channel) for rapid response to community-reported technical issues and scam reports.

Expected Impact:
*   Increased Voter Turnout: By providing accessible support and addressing community concerns, we anticipate a modest increase in voter turnout (target: 0.5% increase in future referenda).
*   Improved Community Safety: Reduced instances of scam victimization and increased user confidence within the Polkadot ecosystem.
*   Strengthened Community Engagement: Fostering a more supportive and collaborative environment, leading to greater participation in governance and ecosystem development.  The “Polkadot Pathfinder” program will directly address the need for increased accessibility and awareness.
