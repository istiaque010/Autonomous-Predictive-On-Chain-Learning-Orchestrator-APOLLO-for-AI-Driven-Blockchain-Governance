    "insight_summary": "Polkadot governance continues to show moderate activity, with 1544 referenda created, but execution remains low at 55.5%. Turnout is exceptionally weak, averaging just 2.52% and a median of 2.17%, indicating a significant barrier to participation.  Monthly counts are declining sharply, particularly in 2025 (November - February), falling to just 19 in April.  The average duration of proposals is 19.89 days.  High rejection rates (27.8%) alongside low turnout suggest a need to improve proposal clarity and accessibility.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the declining participation and the factors driving high rejection rates."
